# Rat in a Maize
## Project Overview
The **Rat in a Maze** is a project written in Java that utilizes a backtracking algorithm to find a path for the rat to reach all the food located in the maize field. You can either guide the rat to find the food yourself or let the program play automatically on its own.


## How to play

There are symbols that designate the following items:
 -  **R** is a rat in a maize
 - **F** is foods in a maize
 - **1** is paths that the rat can walk on
 - **0** is fences that the rat cannot pass through
 
You can guide the rat to find the all food by yourself or let the program play automatically. If there is no available path for the rat to reach the food, the program will notify you that there is no way for the rat to find the food and will terminate.


## Requirements


This program is developed in Java and requires a maize text file to operate. You can either create your own maize file or use the provided files:

-   **5x5 Maize**: `maize_1.txt` have two foods, `maize_3.txt` have one food.
-   **6x4 Maize**: `maize_2.txt` have two foods, `maize_4.txt` have one food.

**Note**: Without a maize file, the program will not run, as it requires reading the file from the computer. and If you create the maà¸£ze file yourself, you must represent the mouse's position with 'R', the food's position with 'F', the paths the mouse can walk with '1', and the fences that the mouse cannot pass through with '0'.
